## Moon.js ES6 SCSS Boilerplate
Moon.js / Moon.js Router / ES6 / SCSS

This is simply a boilerplate for quickly getting started using Moon.js with Parcel in ES6.

Make sure to have parcel installed globally.
```
$ npm i -G parcel
```

Then you could start a development server by running
```
$ npm start
```
